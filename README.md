# Mini Coup
### [Click here to play!](https://www.minicoup.io)

An online adaptation of the card game Coup, built for my friends and I but available to anyone :)

The current version allows multiple games to run concurrently; games can be joined via URL or by entering the game room's number from the home page. It's also optimized for both mobile and desktop. If you notice any bugs I haven't caught, I'd be glad if you let me know. 

The server was built using Node (with Express for some routing & WS during gameplay), and the client using Svelte (with Page.js for client-side routing). All drawings were done in Procreate :) 

Now for some images. First, the cards:
