# Mini Coup
### [Click here to play!](https://www.minicoup.io)

An online adaptation of the card game Coup, built for my friends and I but available to anyone :)

The current version allows multiple games to run concurrently; games can be joined via URL or by entering the game room's number from the home page. It's also reasonably optimized for both mobile and desktop. If you notice any bugs I haven't caught, I'd be glad if you let me know. 

Speaking of which, here are the cards:

The server was built using Node (with Express for some routing & WS during gameplay), and the client using Svelte (with Page.js for client-side routing). All drawings were done in Procreate :)
